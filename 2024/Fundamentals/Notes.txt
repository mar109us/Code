JS can be inserted anywhere in an html file with <script> tag

old html (html4) required scripts to have a type

<script type="text/javascript"> <!-- COMMENTS //--> </script> === really old code, ancient stuff, was meant for older browser that couldnt run JS

script files are attached to html with the src attribute:
<script src="/path/to/script.js"></script>

./ === script is in current folder

or can give full url

can also use multiple scripts

only simple scripts are put in html files

___________

statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.

alert() = statement

semicolon is used to seperate statements ;;;;;;;;;

if no semicolon before a bracket [] js will not autofill a semicolon ;

ex 
alert()
[1].forEach(alert); 
= 
alert()[1].forEach(alert);

alert();
[1].forEach(alert); 
=
alert();
[1].forEach(alert); 

it is safer to use semicolons ;

comments = //

multiline comment =
/*
*/

comment hotkey = ctrl + k + c

use strict = "modern" javascript
it goes on top of scripts


to check if a website is strict, open console and insert code:

function isStrictMode() {
    return (typeof this == 'undefined');
}


from reddit: 
Use strict necessary?

It's not necessary, but its helpful. It catches issues you might otherwise 
have missed, for example throwing errors in cases where when not in strict mode, 
things would simply silently fail with you none the wiser.

Note that anything inside a class block is already in strict mode, 
as is all code in modules. If you're only writing code for 
modules, you won't have to include "use strict" anywhere because its already implied.
