ECMA-262 = Definiton av JS 

"ECMAScript is a standard for scripting languages, including JavaScript, JScript, and 
ActionScript. It is best known as a JavaScript standard intended to ensure the interoperability 
of web pages across different web browsers."

ECMAScript is a cross-platform, general-purpose scripting language and is not tied 
to web browsers alone. ECMA-262 defines the standards based on which more-robust 
scripting language may be built. ECMA-262 defines the following parts of the language 
and does not refer to web browsers at all

Syntax

Statements
Keywords
Reserved Words

Reddit: What is ECMAScript and why does it matter?
Basically, anything we call JavaScript is actually ECMAScript. 
JavaScript as a name is actually copyrighted, so it cannot be used as the official name of the language. 
ECMA, the group that maintains and updates the specifications for the language, lends their name to the 
newer specifications, resulting in the ECMAScript name. This is why the new version 
of JavaScript is referred to as ES6 or ES2015.
